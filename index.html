    <p>There are so many perks to the world of food online. With just a few clicks, you can find inspiration from
        virtually any recipe box and breeze through

            rel="noopener noreferrer">cookbooks</a> in the time it takes to pull one off the shelf. But, the downside?
        Sometimes the recipes you love get lost in the mix.
    </p>
    <p>As anyone with a Netflix subscription knows, too much choice can be overwhelming. Sure, you can rely on the first
        banana bread recipe that pops up in a Google search, but we know there’s nothing better than returning to a
        tried-and-true favorite—the one you know always turns out perfectly, using ingredients you always have on hand.
        And when you finally find a recipe that works every time, you don’t want it to disappear into the depths of the
        internet.</p>
    <p>So, we’d like to introduce you to the best way to keep all your trusted recipes close by. Bookmarks, you can take
        a break—we’ve got it from here.</p>
    <h1><strong>Introducing to my recipe</strong></h1>
    <h1><em>Chef John's Fresh Salmon Cakes</em></h1>
    <img src="3.jpg" height="20%" width="20%">
    <p>Salmon cakes are one of my go-to emergency meals. Every once in a while I like to use fresh salmon. Salmon is one
        of those products, like chicken, that's very easy to get into a rut with. People generally find a few recipes
        that work for them, and just stay with those, but this fairly simple preparation should be easy to add to
        anyone's rotation. Serve with lemon wedge and remoulade sauce. You can use any bread crumbs instead of panko
        breadcrumbs, if desired.</p>
    <h1><strong>Ingredients</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><strong>Directions</strong></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, red pepper, celery, and a
            pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add capers; cook and stir
            until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Stir salmon, onion mixture, mayonnaise, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, garlic, mustard, cayenne, seafood seasoning,
            salt, and ground black pepper together in a bowl until well-mixed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
            refrigerate until firmed and chilled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
